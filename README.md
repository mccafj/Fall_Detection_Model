# Overview

Immediately after the title, write a very short description of the problem you are solving, the data you are using to solve it, and how well your model solves the problem
This should be no more than a couple of sentences

Describe the data used in the model
This does not mean that you should list out every single column name and data type. Instead, describe the data generally.
Identify the target
What are you predicting?
Communicate the rationale for predicting this target with this data
This can be very brief. The goal is to avoid a "so what?" response
Evaluate the final model's performance

Note: There is NO threshold for model performance you are required to meet. So long as you explain what you tried and properly evaluate the outcome, it's fine to have a model with poor performance. We recognize that your time is limited during Capstone and we want you to focus more on the process and communication, not worrying about model performance.

# Business and Data Understanding

Explain the project context, using at least one citation to demonstrate your domain understanding
Consider including visualizations here as well

# Modeling

What kind of model(s) did you use?
How well did your final model perform, compared to the baseline?
